    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <div>
        <p>I'm Matteo Roberts, a 17-year-old student from North West London with a strong interest in science, technology, and design. I recently achieved an A * in A-Level Mathematics a year early, alongside straight grade 9s in all 11 of my GCSEs. I'm passionate about problem-solving and creativity, which is why I enjoy both coding and exploring scientific ideas. Looking ahead, I aspire to study Physics or Engineering at university, where I can apply my skills to real-world challenges.</p>
        <p>Outside of school, I love music, especially David Bowie, and I'm an avid supporter of Tottenham Hotspur. I also enjoy sports, including cricket, rugby, and running, which help me stay active and focused while balancing my academic and creative interests.</p>
